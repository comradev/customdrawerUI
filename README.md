# customdrawerUI

This drawer is made from the design of 3d flip menu by Minh Pham on dribbble.

## Getting Started

There are two widget, the product page and the drawer. Instead of using drawer widget for the drawer, a fresh MaterialApp widget is used for the drawer. Then, animationController is used to move the desired widgets in desired manner.
.
The second part of this is the 3D object. It is from a C4D object, exported as frames in png format. Then, the image url is given dynamically in line with the animationController.value value.
